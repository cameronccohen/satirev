Rocha ’19 narrowly managed to avoid showing his parents his beer-filled dorm room this Parents Weekend, maintaining their belief that the 18-year-old freshman has yet to ever consume alcohol.</p><p>His parents Jim and Carol Rocha, here for Freshman Parents Weekend, were returning to Harvard Yard with Jacob after dinner at Toscano, when the wide-eyed first-year remembered with a fright that in the common room of his Weld suite were scattered no less than three empty cans of Keystone Light. Thinking quickly, Jacob frantically diverted his parents to take a family photo on the steps of Widener Library. This gave his suitemate Wilson M. Park ’19 enough time to covertly carry those empties out to the hallway bathroom, clearing the common room of all evidence of alcohol use.</p><p>Jim and Carol expressed pleasure at the fact that he seemed to be “settling in well” and “getting his bearings.” His mother noted that his dorm room was surprisingly clean, and his father added that he seemed to be “really putting academics first.”</p><p>“I just hope he’s making friends,” Carol said after a pause. “It doesn’t seem like he or his roommates are drinking at all.” “Which is fine, of course,” she quickly added with a half-hearted smile. “But it’s okay to have a little responsible fun if he wants to!”</p><p>“Most kids start experimenting with drugs and alcohol around this time,” Jim continued. “Jacob’s never been most kids, though, I suppose...”</p><p>At press time, the proud parents have not yet begun making subtle, concerned inquiries into Jacob’s dating life in college so far. When asked what he would say, Jacob responded that he would “definitely not” tell them about the girl he almost made out with at First Chance Dance earlier this semester.</p><p> </p><p>Image Source: The Bouqs Company</p>",Harvard    Freshman    Parents' Weekend

Wish you would stop having sex with guys you’re only 60% into just for the temporary feeling of completeness? Here are four emotional voids that scallion pancakes will fill but he won’t:</p><p align=""center"" style=""text-align: left;""> </p><p><strong>1) The ""emotionally detached parent"" void </strong></p><p>After a childhood devoid of any parental love or affection, you have no concept of what a healthy relationship looks like. Let some freshly made scallion pancakes give you the warm, gentle embrace that your stoic father never did — and that Jeff never could.</p><p><strong>2) The ""lack of defining purpose"" void</strong></p><p>You have fleeting interests but no real passions. Your strategy for the last four years has been to choose the path of least resistance. That includes never breaking up with your high school boyfriend, even though you live on opposite ends of the country and both deeply resent each other. Instead of drowning yourself in toxic commitments, drown yourself in sauce! The six layered, chewy-crunchy sauce vehicles you get at the Kong will be the closest thing to a defining purpose you’ve ever experienced. </p><p><strong>3) The ""utter absence of self-love"" void </strong></p><p>Self-flagellating and hypercritical, you rely on attention from a string of emotionally reserved men to feel any semblance of self-worth. Ditch the narcissistic soft boys and go for some flaky and perfectly golden scal pals — at least they won’t insist on explaining all 18 chapters of “Ulysses” to you.</p><p><strong>4) General void </strong></p><p>You’ve been numb for so long that you don’t even know why, and you can’t remember a time when that wasn't the case. Your string of one-night stands is so ineffective that you don’t even know why you bother swiping. Talk to your doctor about signs of clinical depression. Afterward, celebrate finally getting diagnosed with some trusty ol’ scallion pancakes for $5.25 at the Kong. </p><p>If for some reason scallion pancakes don’t work, try take-out sushi and four $10 bottles of rose from C’est Bon.

It will only take a couple seconds I swear!”</p><p>“Well alright, if you insist,” said Yarmouth as he carefully placed the serving tray he was holding onto the nearest table, unbuttoned his jacket, and smoothed back his hair. “Shall I be getting the door for you, Master Barron?”</p><p>“No. We’ll get the door—together,” said the boy with an endearing smile. The adventurous couple crossed the threshold, carefully closed the door behind them, and thus entered the long-lost Lincoln Library.</p><p>“My word!” exclaimed Yarmouth. “After all these years I can’t believe I missed it. This is quite a collection!” Spotting a first edition copy of <em>David Copperfield</em>, Yarmouth pulled the book off the shelf. A moment later, the duo heard a strange noise from above.</p><p>“What was that, Reginald?” asked a suddenly nervous Barron.</p><p>“Why I believe it’s…it’s…” stammered Yarmouth as he looked up and saw, barreling down upon them, an enormous bust of the fourteenth President of the United States, Franklin Pierce.</p><p>“It’s a trap! RUN!”</p><p>Yarmouth scooped up the Trump lad, bounded toward the secret door, and—in the nick of time—secured a safe exit. They heard a loud thud from behind the now-closed door.</p><p>“Wow, that was amazing!” screamed an out-of-breath Barron.</p><p>“I say, we’re lucky that bust didn’t <em>pierce</em> right through us!” quipped Yarmouth, and the two shared a laugh. “Come now Master Barron. Off to bed.”</p><p>“Aww, but I want to go on another adventure!” the child whined as Yarmouth escorted him back to his bedroom.</p><p>“My dear boy, don’t despair!

Harvard Ecologist Maps Yard Link Migrations,Harvard,8.jpg    http://satirev.org/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/field/image/Yard_Link.jpg?itok=CzXt7dzW    http://satirev.org/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/field/image/Yard_Link.jpg?itok=CzXt7dzW,"<p>On Tuesday, Harvard ecologist Daniel Beterman completed a five-year study mapping the migration patterns of the string fencing in the yard. The study yielded some incredible findings.</p><p>“Using aerial camera technology, we found that the yard links form the shape of a large middle finger that, as the seasons progress, points at different freshman dorms,” said Beterman.</p><p> “Freshmen are often frustrated because the shifts in the link patterns disrupt their walking routes. So, we don’t think this offensive pattern is a random occurrence.”</p><p>Unlike anything ecologists have seen in the wild, the study’s unnatural results surprised many students.</p><p>“I always thought that the yard links were pointless,” said Kane Cole ’16. “I mean, they are there to keep people off the grass, but they are so easy to step over. But now I guess, since they’re a pointing finger, they do have a point.”</p><p>While the middle finger formation is the most common shape, the study also found other link structures such as a veritaffle, a government 1310 exam, and a penis that shrinks as winter gets colder right before primal scream.</p><p> As of now, no one knows exactly why the ropes make theses formations; but ecologists have determined that every formation is meant to poke fun at faculty, students or staff.</p><p>“I guess that’s one serious case of rope burn!” said Beterman, who doesn’t get out much except for when he is mapping the migration patterns of inanimate objects. “We don’t know why the links are so bitter about the school, but that mystery is just one more yard link in the chain.”</p>",Harvard    Harvard Yard    Ecology

""Perverts and communists getting in my way,"" I mumbled, but when I looked down to kick the hobo in the chest, I found instead a young man. It gave me pause, and I looked at him for a while before my roommate told me to hurry the hell along.<br/>
""This boy has been the victim of a conspiracy,"" I responded, to which he replied that he did not give a rat's ass. ""You don't understand, you're not American, this is about America, the red white and blue!"" As I walked off while my roommate started yelling at me in some garbled moon language I decided that I would never let this happen to any Harvard kid ever again. Here is my advice on the matter, take it.<br/>
Alcohol, Weed, Cocaine, Heroin<br/>
Are you above the age of 16? If you do not know what these are you are not trying hard enough. Go on, scoot!<br/>
Mushrooms, LSD<br/>
You roll through life like a coyote<br/>
through the desert plains of hell tearing ass as you sip juma-juma juice from a golden cup. A gigantic car, a roaring piece of the American dream is enveloped around you like a banana yellow metal condom. That is what I see, feel. I'm sweating an enormous amount, toxins erupting from my body and collecting in a pool around the leather seats of the vehicle. Bats pass around me and collapse writhing on the ground, victims of a poisonous aura that is the result of eight days of well whiskey. A star erupts in the distance and my eyes turn to jelly, I go temporarily blind. Moments later I hear the hellbat shriek and realize that I got a police car right behind me. I could chance it, but I'm in Reno and they use helicopters out here. One stop later, I see a mass of blubber and grey walk towards me, and bear my teeth. I lie, he doesn't buy it, I headbutt<br/>
the man, and three hours later the car is at the bottom of a ravine and I'm walking towards a casino with a broken nose.<br/>
Take psychedelics<br/>
on nice days, be positive to avoid a bad trip.<br/>
Ecstacy<br/>
This crap will make you dance like a storm gerbil is stapled to your scrotum. You'll feel cosmic love, a great feeling. Walking down the road, hug the first person you see, first person to exist<br/>
by God's good grace. You'll see a woman and her daughter in the distance, you got your arms out, walking towards. The woman turns out to be blind in one eye and the daughter is a little boy in a leather jacket with ass length black hair. Moments later you see a toothless man selling painted Dunkin' Donuts cups and calling it ""found art.""<br/>
Remember to drink water.<br/>
Speed<br/>
Have you ever felt like your heart is going to explode, a ball of energy? Simultaneous, crunchy, red.red.red.red. So much energy your teeth fall out. If there was a ready supply, this would crush red bull to become Harvard's #1 drug of choice. Proof: you lose your teeth and never sleep.<br/>

LOUIS, MO – At Vice President Mike Pence's recent speech at a vandalized Jewish cemetery, Trump supporters in the crowd were unsure how to react as Pence said something civil.</p><p>Scattered cheers and chants were heard from the crowd, but uncomfortable silence predominated when Pence started denouncing anti-Semitism.</p><p>“I voted for Trump and Pence, and I’ve been to many of their rallies,” said local resident Sam Jamerson. “It fires me up to hear them trash the dishonest media and crooked politicians. When I heard the Vice President was coming to town, I figured there would be more of that.”</p><p>Jamerson paused and frowned. “This is less my thing, though,” he said, regarding Pence’s speech condemning hatred and violence.</p><p>Other attendees shared Jamerson’s disconcertion. “I brought my ‘Build That Wall’ sign with me today, but it doesn’t really feel appropriate,” said Susan Morse. “Normally, I like to get the people near me chanting ‘Make America Great Again’ or ‘Lock Her Up.’ But when I tried that today, nobody joined in.""</p><p>As it became clear that Pence’s speech was not going to center around his usual themes, the confusion among attendees gave way to disappointment. “Don’t get me wrong, I love this administration,” said Jamerson. “It’s just, when I drove out here today, I was ready to get angry about Obamacare. This love-and-care-for-the-Jewish-community stuff is fine, I guess, but I like the old stuff better.”</p><p>Crowd enthusiasm reached a fever pitch when Pence singled out someone in attendance, but that excitement faded as people realized that Pence was merely welcoming the Missouri governor.  “I thought we were going to get to boo someone, maybe even spit at them,” said Morse. “What a bummer.”</p>",Mike Pence    wait what I expected some outrage    we still want to lock her up though right?

Crazy, huh? Like, how was I supposed to make that connection?” Pruitt admits that Ernest Moniz, former Secretary of Energy, had warned about the dangers of global warming, but Pruitt had dismissed Moniz as “just another nuclear physicist who doesn’t know what he’s talking about.” Pruitt’s environmental policies were instead guided by Rick Perry, whom Pruitt praised as “someone who really knows his stuff.” </div><div> </div><div>“Our deepest condolences to the polar bears,” said Perry. “They’re probably pretty fucked now.”</div><div> </div><div>The Earth’s death comes after American reinvestment in oil and gas, and the construction of new coal plants across the country. “I mean, I know it’s a dying technology, and produces 39 percent of carbon dioxide emissions, but what else were we supposed to do?

to reporters earlier this week regarding speculation of Moses' appointment,<br/>
describing him as ""not the Jew to lead us through the 21<sup>st</sup><br/>
century.""</p><p>Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell<br/>
(R-KY) stated much more freely upon hearing the news, ""Let's be real;  the only<br/>
reason this man is not an ex-con is because the judicial system was so weak in<br/>
his heyday. He's murdered Egyptians, and that can't be good for our image out<br/>
there, in addition to cursing them with more plagues than I can easily count,<br/>
and we want to reward this man with an international relations post? I don't<br/>
think so, no way.""</p><p>Some of McConnell's Republican<br/>
allies, however, have expressed great enthusiasm at the fledgling president's<br/>
decision, most notably former presidential nominee John McCain (R-AZ). McCain<br/>
told reporters earlier today, ""I don't care what anybody says, this man is a war<br/>
hero, just like me. At least I was only in Hanoy for five years. Can you believe<br/>
he wandered the desert for forty?""</p><p>He furthered the comparison, stating, ""We can't deny his maverick status; he's a uniter, not a<br/>
divider, and he's respected by Muslims and Jews alike. Sure, he's a got a few<br/>
years on him, but I think men our age are actually sharper than the younger<br/>
generation. My only question is, if Barack Obama wanted somebody so much like<br/>
me, why didn't he just get me for the job?"" McCain's former vice presidential<br/>
nominee, too, stated with glee, ""It's great to see real Americans like Joe the<br/>
Plumber and Moses the Prophet getting involved in politics.""</p><p>The reaction from the population as<br/>
a whole also remains mixed. Pro-choicers have described Moses in recent years as<br/>
""'an old windbag who claims to talk to God more often than he talks to his<br/>
mother,' while pro-life groups take his anti-abortion stance with a grain of<br/>
salt, citing his involvement in the Egyptian Tenth Plague Scandal 2700 years<br/>
ago.</p><p>President Elect Obama also<br/>
expressed a degree of ambivalence. ""I respect the man, but we disagree on a good<br/>
number of things, generally stemming from the birth of Jesus Christ onwards. The<br/>
thing is, I like that about him. He brings a different view, which you've got to<br/>
expect with his level of experience. Moses governed the Israelites until he was<br/>
120, and he's arguably the first real legislator in recorded history. He's a<br/>
smart guy and I know we're both approaching our new jobs in a post-partisan<br/>
state of mind.""</p><p>An e-mail sent to Moses was not<br/>
initially returned in time for this article, though his publicist indicated in a<br/>
phone call with SatireV reporters that Moses is ""both honored and humbled to be<br/>
a part of this ""historic administration."" ""Neither locusts nor frogs will keep<br/>
Moses from crossing this sea of a challenge.""</p>",
An Open Letter to Drew Faust from Digress Harvard,Harvard,15.jpg    http://satirev.org/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/field/image/unnamed_9.jpg?itok=AMnXAp5C    http://satirev.org/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/field/image/unnamed_9.jpg?itok=AMnXAp5C,"<p>Dear President Faust:</p><p>As a liberal arts university—which historically was a place of learning focused on the seven artes liberales of Grammar, Rhetoric, Logic, Arithmetic, Geometry, Music, and Astronomy but now is more about the development of the student as an individual without necessarily focusing on any particular field—we have many obligations. Fossil Fuels—which is actually not using fossils like dinosaur footprints and leafs as fuel, though that would be pretty neat—are harmful to the environment (environment comes etymologically from Carlyle’s translations of the German Umgebung for “the state of being environed, or surrounded”). And President Faust, we need to keep our Umgebung whole.</p><p>Harvard needs to be careful about poking its endowment around the Umgebung. Our $35.883 billion endowment could be used to buy 5.381 TRILLION colorful beads from Amazon.com ($35 billion at $14.65 for a 22,000 count of beads. BOOM arithmetic baby! artes liberales maximoniousnessly!) For reference, the island of Manhattan was purchased by Dutch settlers from the Canarsee Indians (who did not actually have a rightful claim to the island, but only to the area now known as Brooklyn) in exchange for $24 worth of beads. If the value of Manhattan is worth $802.4 billion as it was in 2006, that comes up to $1.204 QUADRILLION BEADS! Now that is quadrillion as used in short scale countries (i.e. on the scale 10<sup>15</sup>, SI prefix peta-) rather than as used in long scale countries (which would be 10<sup>24</sup>, or one million million million million, SI prefix yotta-). Even though this short scale/long scale divide is based mostly in language—with English speaking countries aligning with the short scale and Dutch and Romance language-influenced areas using the long scale—all of that is beside the point, President Faust! What matters here is that the Dutch purchase of Manhattan was illegitimate. It would of course be an egregious error to claim that American Indian culture did not have an understanding of private property ownership and free market trade situations (cf. Miller, Robert J. 2002), but nevertheless the “sale” was most likely considered to be more of a lease on hunting and trading rights in the area!</p><p>How can we even begin to consider the value of the Island of Manhattan in terms of beads if we have to translate between two different ideological systems of property? With a Liberal Arts degree in Translation, of course! And that is why I want to thank you for officially recognizing the Hawaiian language as eligible to fulfill students’ language requirements. </p><p>E kōkua mai!

Kim Jong-Il Finally Receives Entrance Into Nuclear Club,World,25.jpg    http://satirev.org/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/field/image/kim-jong-il-finally-receives-entrance.jpg?itok=UYYFprZr    http://satirev.org/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/field/image/kim-jong-il-finally-receives-entrance.jpg?itok=UYYFprZr,"<p>LOS ALAMOS, NM — Years after starting his country’s nuclear program, North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Il has finally joined the exclusive Nuclear Club. Following confirmation of the North Korean nuclear test on October 9th, acting Club Chair George W. Bush officially extended an invitation to the idiosyncratic leader of the newly-nuclear Communist regime, which was quickly accepted by the diminutive dictator. In accordance with club by-laws, Kim Jong-Il’s entry was sponsored by two current members, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Hu Jintao, both of whom wrote glowing letters of recommendation.</p><p>Kim Jong-Il has long coveted an invitation to the Club. Following his initiation into the group, he was overheard saying to one of his aides, “I don’t know if the guys over at the Nuclear Club knew just how much this meant to me. I’ve been itching to get inside those club gates ever since the club lobbied for the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty to limit membership to, you know, the right kind of people.” He added, “I can’t wait to tee off on their Three Mile Island golf course.”</p><p>Besides the golf course, the club also has numerous other amenities for the select few who claim membership. These luxuries include fine wines and cigars, gym facilities, cheap and clean power, a light-water Jacuzzi, and of particular interest to the Dear Leader, complimentary hair-styling. The price for membership is high, and requires onerous amounts of spending on the military-industrial complex. According to Kim-Jong Il, “It’s not easy to pay dues; I have people starving in the streets. But it’s so worth it to have that special place where you can just get away from the world.”</p><p>Discussions for admitting any new member are rough, but the turmoil surrounding the North Korean leader’s admission was particularly divisive. While current member Hu Jintao was a strong advocate for admission, acting Club Chair George W. Bush expressed reservations. “He’s a fine man, but he mingles with the wrong set,” said President Bush, in records of a secret board meeting leaked to Satire V. “Plus, I don’t know if I would want a member who might consider Spot a delicious meal.” Spot, President Bush’s English Springer Spaniel, was unavailable for comment.</p><p>Several other leaders are currently pursuing sponsorship, but as of now it’s unclear whether the Nuclear Club is ready for any new blood. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, President of Iran, has been seeking membership for some time now and obtained sponsorship from Vladimir Putin. While most agree that Iran will gain membership, it most likely will not be accepted for several years.</p><p>The proposed admission of Ehud Olmert, Prime Minister of Israel, is also a perpetual source of conflict. Says Club Chair Bush, “While we’re not your grandfather’s nuclear club, certain rules must never change. Sure, they designed and built the things, but I still have to insist: no Jews.”</p>",

Trojan Releases Penis Flavored Condom ,Everything Else,        ,"<p>The world of flavored condoms was rocked yesterday as Trojan<br/>
released a secret flavor long in development.  The new """"penis flavored"""" condoms<br/>
come at the head of extensive scientific research into men's nether regions.</p><p>Said the Trojan design team, """"Women nowadays want something raw and virile.<br/>
 Something potent.  Cherry and citrus-flavored condoms are too weak for adequate<br/>
arousal.  By contrast, the penis-flavored condom will usher in a new era of<br/>
sexual pleasure.  Society returns to its roots.""""</p><p>The new condom has a unique mix of masculine odors clinically proven to<br/>
heighten arousal in both partners.  The aromatic compound consisting of musk,<br/>
stale urine, man-taint, and week-old dingleberries elicits neuronal interactions<br/>
corresponding to human orgasms.  """"It's almost like I'm blowing my boyfriend<br/>
without the condoms on!"""" said one bodacious babe.</p><p>However, because Trojan""""™s new additional mimics the stench of<br/>
manmeat so closely, undue pregnancies have increased nationwide. Partners<br/>
assuming they were protected in fact were, in fact, barebacking in the sack.<br/>
Trojan has refused to pay reparations, citing the negligence and ancient Trojan<br/>
law.</p>",
